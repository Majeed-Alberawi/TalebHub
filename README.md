TalebHub is a university learning management platform designed to simplify and optimize the educational process for both students and instructors. The platform enables seamless interaction between students, teachers, and administration, providing an organized environment for managing lessons, courses, and academic communication.

## 🧠 Project Idea

This platform is designed by university students for university students, reflecting real academic needs and challenges from the student perspective.
